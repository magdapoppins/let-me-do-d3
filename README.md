## I tried D3 üç∑
Some dabbles in D3.js + HTML + SVG for a talk in Turku ‚ù§ Frontend in November 2019.

### Getting started
To start the app, clone the repository, run `npm install` and then `npm start`. The app opens at `localhost:1234`. This project uses the `Parcel` bundler and `Prettier` for cleaning up the code.

The graphs represent:  
**/frequency.html** - Bar chart of theme occurances per book.  
**/force.html** - Book theme occurances os bubbles.   
**/spirit.html** Book theme % of total themes as a color blend.  
**/structure.html** Theme and subtheme structure.
